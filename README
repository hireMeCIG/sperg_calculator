To use this sperg calculator, call the rake tasks.

Use this handy task to calculate daily theoretical sperg jpeg waste
> rake calculate

Specify what the daily revenue was that day!
> rake calculate daily_revenue=<INTEGER>

# Note: We are working on 64-bit precision data for the daily_revenue, expect that in two weeks

Tweak the numbers to craft your own personal sperg's mom's credit-card-backed distribution profile!!!
Just check out sperg_config.yml

We express distinct groups of sperg-delusion as averaged jpeg price-points,
and specify what percentage of the daily aggregate that particular(ly sad) group
contributed to Crobber's Hollywood/Coke fund.

Here's a pretty sweet example!!

distribution:
  base:
    price: 45
    percent: 25

  believer:
    price: 100
    percent: 50

  whale:
    price: 500
    percent: 15

  sperg_whale:
    price: 1000
    percent: 10


Usage and Sample Output:

#### NOTE ABOUT INACCURACIES (Think CIG positive!!)
  You might notice the numbers don't add up
  Don't worry about that. We assume a minimum of $3,000,000 in revenue per month and adjust
  all the rest of the numbers if our daily_revenue didn't match that minimum income to
  "keep the lights on" (*wink wink* right Chris?)
  Don't wanna spook the whales LOL!!
